# HTDP/World.js

A JavaScript port of the World reactive UI library from How To Design Programs

Note that much of the work for this library was done years ago by Chris King, Ethan Cecchetti, and Danny Yoo. Their code largely remains intact, with some changes to work with more modern JavaScript syntax and idioms.
