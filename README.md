# HTDP/World.js

A JavaScript port of the World reactive UI library from How To Design Programs, adapted from the [Pyret online IDE source code](https://github.com/brownplt/code.pyret.org).

Special thanks to [Joe Gibbs Politz](https://twitter.com/jpolitz) for all his work on the Pyret source code, which simplified my task immensely.

Note that much of the work for this library was done years ago by Chris King, Ethan Cecchetti, and Danny Yoo. Their code largely remains intact, with some changes to work with more modern JavaScript syntax and idioms. I am indebted to [Joe Gibbs Politz](https://twitter.com/joepolitz) for his work on Pyret, as well as all the other contributors to the source code for Pyret and the Pyret online IDE.
